# HealthSphere Assignment

## Overview

The assignment involves working with a given dataset to perform various tasks and build a well-performing machine learning model.

## Tasks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explore the provided dataset to gain insights into the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Perform any necessary feature engineering.
   - provided data is already clean

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify and select relevant features for model training.
   - Implement techniques such as correlation analysis or recursive feature importance to make informed choices.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Build a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
   - Optimize the model for performance.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to achieve better results.
   - Utilize techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
   - Implement cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.
